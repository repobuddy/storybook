# Component Specification Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured format for specifying React components before implementation. The specification will be used to create components following the [React Component Specification](mdc:.cursor/rules/development/react_component_spec.mdc).

## Specification Structure

### Component Name
[Component Name]

### Description
[Brief description of the component's purpose and main functionality]

### Research & References
- [ ] Research existing components in the repository
- [ ] Research similar components from popular component libraries (Material UI, Chakra UI, etc.)
- [ ] Document relevant patterns and best practices found

### Features & Behaviors
[ ] Feature/Behavior 1
- Description: [Detailed description]
- Expected behavior: [How it should work]
- Edge cases: [Any special cases to consider]

[ ] Feature/Behavior 2
- Description: [Detailed description]
- Expected behavior: [How it should work]
- Edge cases: [Any special cases to consider]

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ComponentNameProps {
  // List all props with types and descriptions
}
```

### Accessibility Requirements
[ ] [Accessibility requirement 1]
[ ] [Accessibility requirement 2]

### Theme Support
[ ] Light theme implementation
[ ] Dark theme implementation
[ ] Custom theme variables

### Testing Requirements
[ ] Unit test for [specific functionality]
[ ] Integration test for [specific functionality]
[ ] Accessibility test for [specific functionality]

### Performance Considerations
[ ] [Performance consideration 1]
[ ] [Performance consideration 2]

### Documentation Requirements
[ ] Component API documentation
[ ] Usage examples
[ ] Props documentation
[ ] Storybook stories for all variants

## Implementation Notes
- The implementation will follow the React Component Specification
- All features will be validated through Storybook stories
- Each checkbox will be marked as completed when the feature is implemented and tested
- The implementation will include proper TypeScript types and documentation

## Example Specification

### Component Name
Button

### Description
A versatile button component that supports different variants, sizes, and states.

### Research & References
- [ ] Research existing button components in the repository
- [ ] Research Material UI Button component
- [ ] Research Chakra UI Button component
- [ ] Document common button patterns

### Features & Behaviors
[ ] Basic Button
- Description: Standard button with text and optional icon
- Expected behavior: Renders as a clickable button with proper styling
- Edge cases: Long text, empty text, icon only

[ ] Button Variants
- Description: Support for different visual styles (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Expected behavior: Applies correct styling based on variant prop
- Edge cases: Custom variant combinations

[ ] Button States
- Description: Support for different states (disabled, loading, etc.)
- Expected behavior: Visual feedback for each state
- Edge cases: State transitions, multiple states

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### Accessibility Requirements
[ ] Proper ARIA attributes
[ ] Keyboard navigation support
[ ] Focus management
[ ] Screen reader support

### Theme Support
[ ] Light theme implementation
[ ] Dark theme implementation
[ ] Custom theme variables

### Testing Requirements
[ ] Unit test for click handler
[ ] Unit test for disabled state
[ ] Unit test for loading state
[ ] Integration test for form submission
[ ] Accessibility test for keyboard navigation

### Performance Considerations
[ ] Memoization of callback functions
[ ] Optimized re-renders
[ ] Bundle size optimization

### Documentation Requirements
[ ] Component API documentation
[ ] Usage examples
[ ] Props documentation
[ ] Storybook stories for all variants
