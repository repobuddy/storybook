### Frontmatter Rules

- **Package names**: Use exact package names from `package.json`
- **Version types**: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`
- **Multiple packages**: List all affected packages
- **Important**: **Package names must match exactly as in `package.json` (including scope, if any).**

## Validation Steps

### Pre-Creation Validation

1. **Check if changeset is needed**:
   - Does the change affect public APIs?
   - Is it a user-facing change?
   - Will it require a version bump?

2. **Identify affected packages**:
   - Review `git status --porcelain`
   - Check package.json files for correct names

3. **Determine version type**:
   - Major: Breaking changes
   - Minor: New features
   - Patch: Bug fixes
