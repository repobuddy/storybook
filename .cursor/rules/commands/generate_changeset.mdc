Brief description of the changes.

More detailed explanation if needed.

BREAKING CHANGE: Description of breaking changes if any.
```

### Frontmatter Rules

- **Package names**: Use exact package names from `package.json`
- **Version types**: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`
- **Multiple packages**: List all affected packages
- **Important**: **Package names must match exactly as in `package.json` (including scope, if any).**

## When Not to Create a Changeset

Do **not** create a changeset when the change is limited to:

- **Stories** (e.g. `*.stories.tsx`, story files): Story-only changes do not affect the published package.
- **Documentation** (e.g. `*.mdx`, `*.md`, docs-only updates): Documentation-only changes do not require a version bump.

Do **not** mention or include changes to stories or documentation in the changeset description. Focus the description on public API, behavior, or user-facing functionality only.

## Validation Steps

### Pre-Creation Validation

1. **Check if changeset is needed**:
   - Does the change affect public APIs?
   - Is it a user-facing change?
   - Will it require a version bump?
   - **Skip the changeset** if the only changes are to stories or documentation.

2. **Identify affected packages**:
   - Review `git status --porcelain`
   - Check package.json files for correct names

3. **Determine version type**:
   - Major: Breaking changes
   - Minor: New features
   - Patch: Bug fixes
