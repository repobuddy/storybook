# Cursor Rules Management

Guidelines for managing cursor rules in this repository.

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/master.mdc)**: Central reference for all rules that must be understood.
- **[Naming Conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/naming_conventions.mdc)**: File naming conventions that must be followed.
- **[Markdown Guidelines](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/markdown.mdc)**: Content formatting standards that must be applied.

## Quick Reference

- **Categories**: agents, commands, guidelines, templates
- **Naming**: Use `snake_case` for all rule files
- **Location**: Place in appropriate category subfolder
- **Structure**: Follow the provided template with frontmatter
- **Globs**: Use simple patterns, avoid brace expansion

## Best Practices

- **Keep Rules Focused**: Each rule should have a single, clear purpose.
- **Keep Rules Short**: Omit details that are well known to the AI agent.
- **Clear Documentation**: Write rules that are easy to understand and follow.
- **Use Examples**: Include both good and bad examples.

## Rules Categories

Cursor rules can be categorized based on its purpose:

### Agents

**Purpose**: Rules for AI agent behavior and management
**Examples**: Summary Commit, Cursor Rules Guidelines, Rule Usage
**When to use**: For rules that control how the AI agent should behave

### Commands

**Purpose**: Step-by-step commands for the AI agent to perform specific tasks
**Examples**: Implementation workflows, task-specific guidance, process documentation
**When to use**: For rules that describe how to accomplish specific tasks or follow processes

### Guidelines

**Purpose**: Opinionated best practices on specific topics
**Examples**: Commit Message, Naming Conventions, Formatting Standards, Coding Style, Best Practices
**When to use**: For rules that establish standards, conventions, or best practices

### Templates

**Purpose**: Templates for the AI agent to use
**Examples**: Rule templates, Workflow templates, etc.
**When to use**: For rules that provide templates for the AI agent to use

### Special Cases

The `master.mdc` is a special case that does not belong to any category.
It is placed directly under the `.cursor/rules` folder.

## Directory Structure

Rule files should be placed in the appropriate folder based on its category:

```sh
.cursor/rules/
├── master.mdc                              # Central reference (special file)
├── agents/                                 # Rules for AI agent behavior and management

    └── component_spec_template.mdc         # Component specification template
```

## Naming Convention

- **Make names descriptive** of the rule's purpose
- **Place in appropriate category subfolder** (see categories above)

❌ **Bad names:**

- `ReactComponent.mdc` (PascalCase)
- `react-component.mdc` (kebab-case)
- `react_component.md` (wrong extension)
- `component.mdc` (too generic)

✅ **Good names:**

- `react_component.mdc`
- `commit_message.mdc`
- `storybook_story.mdc`
- `tailwindcss.mdc`

## Rule File Structure

### Frontmatter Requirements

The `globs` field is optional and is used to specify the file patterns where this rule applies (e.g., `src/**/*.tsx`)

- **Important**: Complex glob patterns are not supported
- **Example**: `*.{ts,tsx}` does not work - use `*.ts,*.tsx` instead
- **Supported**: Simple patterns like `*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`, `packages/*/src/**/*.ts`
- **Not Supported**: Brace expansion patterns like `*.{ts,tsx}`, `*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`

### Rule Template

The cursor rules should follow this template:

```md
# Rule Title

Brief explanation of the rule's purpose and when to use it.

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Required Rule Name](mdc:.cursor/rules/category/rule_name.mdc)**: Brief explanation of why this rule is required
- **[Another Required Rule](mdc:.cursor/rules/category/another_rule.mdc)**: Brief explanation of why this rule is required

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a new rule, verify:

- [ ] Frontmatter is complete and accurate.
- [ ] File is in the correct category subfolder.
- [ ] Filename follows `snake_case` convention.
- [ ] Content follows the structure template.
- [ ] Format follows markdown guidelines.
- [ ] Examples are clear and practical.
- [ ] Required Rules section references rules that must be followed.
- [ ] Rule is added to `master.mdc`.

```

In the rule template, the following sections are optional:

- **Required Rules**: When the rule does not require any other rules to be followed
- **Quick Reference**: The rule is short and does not need a quick reference
- **Table of Contents**: The rule is short and does not have a table of contents
- **Quality Checklist**: The rule is not complex and does not need a quality checklist

## Updating References

After creating a new rule, update `.cursor/rules/master.mdc` with the new rule.
