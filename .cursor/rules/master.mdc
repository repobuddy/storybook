This document serves as the central reference for all rules in the project.

## Available Rules

1. [React Guidelines](mdc:.cursor/rules/react-guidelines.mdc)
   - Provides best practices and patterns for React development
   - Covers component structure, state management, performance, testing, and more

2. [Cursor Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc)
   - Explains how to add and edit Cursor rules in the project
   - Contains guidelines for rule file structure and location

## How to Use Rules

1. Each rule file contains specific guidelines for a particular aspect of development
2. Rules are automatically applied based on their glob patterns
3. Some rules are always applied (alwaysApply: true)
4. Rules can be referenced in code reviews and development discussions

## Adding New Rules

When adding new rules:
1. Create the rule file in `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Use the `.mdc` extension
3. Follow the standard rule file structure
4. Update this master file to reference the new rule
