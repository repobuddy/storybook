# Markdown Guidelines

This rule provides comprehensive guidelines for writing markdown content that follows best practices and passes markdown linting in this project.

## Required Rules

The AI agent should read and follow these rules along with the subject rule:

- **[Naming Guidelines](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/naming.mdc)**: For consistent file naming conventions that must be followed.

## Quick Reference

- **Code Blocks**: Always specify language (`tsx`, `ts`, `js`, `sh`, `jsonc`).
- **Language IDs**: Use shortest appropriate identifier (`ts` not `typescript`).
- **Links**: Use descriptive text, not "click here".
- **Images**: Include descriptive alt text.
- **Lists**: End list entries with a period when they are complete sentences.
- **Spacing**: Always leave one blank line before and after common markdown elements to ensure proper rendering and readability.
- **Table**: Column widths should match the content rather than being artificially stretched.
