# React Component PRD Guidelines

## Overview
This guide outlines the essential elements to include when creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for React components. A well-structured PRD ensures clear communication between stakeholders and developers, leading to successful component implementation.

For implementation details, refer to the [React Component Specification](mdc:.cursor/rules/development/react_component_spec.mdc).
For Storybook documentation requirements, see [Storybook Stories](mdc:.cursor/rules/development/storybook_stories.mdc).

## PRD Structure

### 1. Component Overview
- Component name and purpose
- Business value and use cases
- Target users/consumers
- Integration points with other components

### 2. Functional Requirements
- Props interface and types
- State management requirements
- Event handlers and callbacks
- Data flow and dependencies
- Error handling expectations

### 3. Technical Specifications
- React version compatibility
- Dependencies and peer dependencies
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance)
- Browser/device compatibility

### 4. Design Requirements
- UI/UX mockups or references
- Responsive design specifications
- Animation and transition requirements
- Theme and styling guidelines
- Dark/light mode support

### 5. Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage expectations
- Integration test scenarios
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing criteria
- Accessibility testing requirements

### 6. Documentation Requirements
- Storybook documentation
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Props documentation
- Component variants

### 7. Timeline and Milestones
- Development phases
- Review checkpoints
- Testing phases
- Documentation deadlines
- Release schedule

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Include specific acceptance criteria
   - Define edge cases and error states

2. **Consider Reusability**
   - Document component variants
   - Specify customization options
   - Include composition patterns

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Define loading states
   - Specify optimization requirements
   - Include bundle size constraints

4. **Accessibility**
   - ARIA requirements
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast requirements

5. **Version Control**
   - Semantic versioning requirements
   - Breaking changes policy
   - Migration guidelines
