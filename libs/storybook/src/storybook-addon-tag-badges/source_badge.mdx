# Source badge

Use the **source** badge to indicate stories that show source code in the docs. The badge displays `</>` with a "Source Code" tooltip.

## Usage

Add the `source` tag to your story and use the `showDocSource()` decorator so the story's source is visible in the docs.

```tsx
import { showDocSource } from '#repobuddy/storybook'

export const YourStory = {
	tags: ['source'],
	decorators: [showDocSource()],
	render: () => <YourComponent />
}
```

Stories tagged with `source` will show the `</>` badge in the sidebar and docs.
