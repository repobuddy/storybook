# Outdated badge

Use the **outdated** badge for components with design changes that were not yet implemented, which can incur extra development costs to your users. The badge displays ⚠️ with an "Outdated" tooltip.

## Usage

Add the `outdated` tag to your story.

```tsx
export const YourStory = {
	tags: ['outdated'],
	render: () => <YourComponent />
}
```
