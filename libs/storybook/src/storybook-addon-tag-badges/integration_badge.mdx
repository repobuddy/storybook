# Integration badge

Use the **integration** badge for stories that serve as integration tests. The badge displays 🔗 with an "Integration Test" tooltip. It is hidden from the sidebar by default.

## Usage

Add the `integration` tag to your story.

```tsx
export const YourStory = {
	tags: ['integration'],
	render: () => <YourComponent />
}
```
