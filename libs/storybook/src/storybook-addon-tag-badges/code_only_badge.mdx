# Code-only badge

Use the **code-only** badge for components that only exist in code and not in design. The badge displays 📝 with a "Code Only" tooltip. This badge is hidden in MDX docs.

## Usage

Add the `code-only` tag to your story.

```tsx
export const YourStory = {
	tags: ['code-only'],
	render: () => <YourComponent />
}
```
